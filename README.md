<h1>Portfolio Bootstrap</h1>
<h2>Things to be afraid of</h2>
<p>This is my second homework assignment and while I feel like now I have gotten a better grasp on bootstrap, I have still not mastered the art of sizing down correctly.</p>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Don't judge so quickly, I might just redo this thing.</li>
  <li>Remember how you were when you were a noob.</li>
  <li>Enjoy yourself and bask in the glory of a mediocre website, that will one day be much much better.</li>
  <li>Accept my apologies now</li>
</ul>
<h2>Deployment</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Used bootstrap for the 3rdish time</li>
  <li>Played with alot with
  classes and realized I should've been much more minimalistic.</li>
  <li>Ground breaking styles with CSS and HTML Attributes</li>
</ul>
<h2>Contributing</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Isaac TA</li>
  <li>Riley TA</li>
</ul>
<p>Without the help from these guys, I'm pretty positive I would not understand as much as I do now.</p>

<h2>Acknowledgments</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Thanks for all the help, as I will continue to learn and implement everything I've been learning</li>
  <li>I know its "not the greatist", however I will come back to this, as I feel I can give it more love as I learn to do more with coding.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks for teaching and reading</p>
